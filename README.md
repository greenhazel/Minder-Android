# Minder

  <!-- We don`t have logo now. -->

Minder is an open-source, flexible, cross-platform app designed for mind, mood tracking and personal diary. 
While Minder aims to become a powerful tool for personal mental health management, this initial commit marks the beginning of that journey.

## 🚀 Vision

Minder is being developed to offer users:

- **Cross-Platform Support:** Use Minder on any device, from Android to iOS and beyond.
- **Flexible Backend:** Choose to self-host, use your own backend, or integrate with Supabase.
- **Data Security:** With AES encryption, your data stays secure and private.
- **Open Source:** Fully open-source, ensuring transparency and community collaboration.

But please note: **None of these features are implemented yet.**

## 📦 Current Status

This repository currently includes:

- The initial setup for an Android application.
- Basic project structure and configuration files.

This is just the starting point, and there's much more to come. Stay tuned!
